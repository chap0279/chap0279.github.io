		<!-- Question 7 -->
			<li>
				<p><strong>Qus:</strong> What element is used to create images? Name its attributes.</p>
				<p><strong>Ans:</strong> img is used to create images and must include a link in the 'src' to the image file (in images folder). It is better to provide 'alt' in any case that the image does not display and must be properly identified. It is also important provide the correct dimension in 'width' and 'height' for proper display on web page.</p>
			</li>
		<!-- Question 8 -->
			<li>
				<p><strong>Qus:</strong> Identify the odd one from these tags: table, tr, b, td and state the reason.</p>
				<p><strong>Ans:</strong> 'b' is the odd tag as it is a block level element and it displays the text in bold instead of normal. The other tags 'table', 'tr', and 'td' are all elements used to create tables in html.</p>
			</li>
		<!-- Question 9 -->
			<li>
				<p><strong>Qus:</strong> Give an example of colour picker input.</p>
				<p><strong>Ans:</strong> Colour picker input is used for fields that require a colour according to design. This would be applicable when several options are provided in a selection box and the colour must be selected and submitted. This can be done with 'form' 'action' 'input' 'color: blue, red, yellow etc...' 'Color' is not actually entered as an option.</p>
			</li>
		<!-- Question 10 -->
			<li>
				<p><strong>Qus:</strong> What is the use of name and value attributes? Give two examples.</p>
				<p><strong>Ans:</strong> The name attribute provides a name for the element. It can be used and referenced in JavaScript.

				The value attribute specifies the value of an 'input' element. It may be used differently for different input types.
					example: 'button value=text'
			</p>
			</li>
		<!-- Question 11 -->
			<li>
				<p><strong>Qus:</strong> Give an example of inline style.</p>
				<p><strong>Ans:</strong> An inline style is found within the html code and will override external or other internal styles that have been applied. An example is h1 style="color:yellow;" This is yellow</p>
			</li>
		<!-- Question 12 -->
			<li>
				<p><strong>Qus:</strong> How would you like an external style sheet? Give example.</p>
				<p><strong>Ans:</strong> Using an external style sheet helps to keep the code clean and allows complex changes. Example: using an external folder for styles will allow styles for many pages comprising of a website.</p>
